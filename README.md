JavaFX Ball Puzzle 
================

This application is a Software Engineering course project, where we were each given a puzzle problem to implement.
The puzzle corresponding to this project was the following:  
&emsp;&emsp;Get the ball in the labyrinth to the goal position.  
&emsp;&emsp;The ball can only move in the four main directions.  
&emsp;&emsp;If it started moving in a direction, it rolls until it hits a wall or the border of the board.    
    
The puzzle is implemented in JavaFX and  based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Records are stored
 in a separate JSON file via Jackson.
